# MIP-VIEWER

The goal of this project is to study how to make a 3d-model viewer like [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com), but more architecture-focused, and open-source so it could evolve more easily in the future.

The final product will not necessarily be a full-working software, but more like a software architecture proposition, with suggestions of different modules - essentially already existing projects available on Github or elsewhere - that could be assembled like "bricks" to result in the wanted software.

This project is made as part of my HES-SO Master of Science in Engineering [(MSE)](https://www.hes-so.ch/en/master-engineering-610.html) studies.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
